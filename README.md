<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


In many programming languages, map is the name of a higher-order function that applies a given function to each element of a collection, e.g. a list or set, returning the results in a collection of the same type. It is often called apply-to-all when considered in functional form.
So what about Smart Contract Development? 

Here're a few properties of mapping in Solidity:
* Mappings are not iterable
* Mapping always returns a value
* If the value was never set, it will return the default value
* You can get values from a nested mapping even when it is not initialized

This repo is not a tutorial, well it's just an example as I mentioned at the heading. We're going to see how to create a map in Solidity smart contract development.

### Built With

This project is built with Solidity. Basically, you don't have to donwload anything to work on Solidity so there are a few online IDE's to do it. Such as;
* [Remix - Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
* [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/)
